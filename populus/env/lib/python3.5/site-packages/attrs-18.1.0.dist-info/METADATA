.. teaser-begin

``attrs`` is the Python package that will bring back the **joy** of **writing classes** by relieving you from the drudgery of implementing object protocols (aka `dunder <https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200605/dunder.html>`_ methods).

Its main goal is to help you to write **concise** and **correct** software without slowing down your code.

.. -spiel-end-

For that, it gives you a class decorator and a way to declaratively define the attributes on that class:

.. -code-begin-

.. code-block:: pycon

   >>> import attr

   >>> @attr.s
   ... class SomeClass(object):
   ...     a_number = attr.ib(default=42)
   ...     list_of_numbers = attr.ib(default=attr.Factory(list))
   ...
   ...     def hard_math(self, another_number):
   ...         return self.a_number + sum(self.list_of_numbers) * another_number


   >>> sc = SomeClass(1, [1, 2, 3])
   >>> sc
   SomeClass(a_number=1, list_of_numbers=[1, 2, 3])

   >>> sc.hard_math(3)
   19
   >>> sc == SomeClass(1, [1, 2, 3])
   True
   >>> sc != SomeClass(2, [3, 2, 1])
   True

   >>> attr.asdict(sc)
   {'a_number': 1, 'list_of_numbers': [1, 2, 3]}

   >>> SomeClass()
   SomeClass(a_number=42, list_of_numbers=[])

   >>> C = attr.make_class("C", ["a", "b"])
   >>> C("foo", "bar")
   C(a='foo', b='bar')


After *declaring* your attributes ``attrs`` gives you:

- a concise and explicit overview of the class's attributes,
- a nice human-readable ``__repr__``,
- a complete set of comparison methods,
- an initializer,
- and much more,

*without* writing dull boilerplate code again and again and *without* runtime performance penalties.

This gives you the power to use actual classes with actual types in your code instead of confusing ``tuple``\ s or `confusingly behaving <http://www.attrs.org/en/stable/why.html#namedtuples>`_ ``namedtuple``\ s.
Which in turn encourages you to write *small classes* that do `one thing well <https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries>`_.
Never again violate the `single responsibility principle <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle>`_ just because implementing ``__init__`` et al is a painful drag.

Testimonials
============

**Amber Hawkie Brown**, Twisted Release Manager and Computer Owl:

  Writing a fully-functional class using attrs takes me less time than writing this testimonial.


**Glyph Lefkowitz**, creator of `Twisted <https://twistedmatrix.com/>`_, `Automat <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Automat>`_, and other open source software, in `The One Python Library Everyone Needs <https://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2016/08/attrs.html>`_:

  I’m looking forward to is being able to program in Python-with-attrs everywhere.
  It exerts a subtle, but positive, design influence in all the codebases I’ve see it used in.


**Kenneth Reitz**, author of `requests <http://www.python-requests.org/>`_, Python Overlord at Heroku, `on paper no less <https://twitter.com/hynek/status/866817877650751488>`_:

  attrs—classes for humans.  I like it.


**Łukasz Langa**, prolific CPython core developer and Production Engineer at Facebook:

  I'm increasingly digging your attr.ocity. Good job!

If you'd like to contribute to ``attrs`` you're most welcome and we've written `a little guide <http://www.attrs.org/en/latest/contributing.html>`_ to get you started!


Release Information
===================

18.1.0 (2018-05-03)
-------------------

Changes
^^^^^^^

- ``x=X(); x.cycle = x; repr(x)`` will no longer raise a ``RecursionError``, and will instead show as ``X(x=...)``.

  `#95 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/95>`_
- ``attr.ib(factory=f)`` is now syntactic sugar for the common case of ``attr.ib(default=attr.Factory(f))``.

  `#178 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/178>`_,
  `#356 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/356>`_
- Added ``attr.field_dict()`` to return an ordered dictionary of ``attrs`` attributes for a class, whose keys are the attribute names.

  `#290 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/290>`_,
  `#349 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/349>`_
- The order of attributes that are passed into ``attr.make_class()`` or the ``these`` argument of ``@attr.s()`` is now retained if the dictionary is ordered (i.e. ``dict`` on Python 3.6 and later, ``collections.OrderedDict`` otherwise).

  Before, the order was always determined by the order in which the attributes have been defined which may not be desirable when creating classes programatically.

  `#300 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/300>`_,
  `#339 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/339>`_,
  `#343 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/343>`_
- In slotted classes, ``__getstate__`` and ``__setstate__`` now ignore the ``__weakref__`` attribute.

  `#311 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/311>`_,
  `#326 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/326>`_
- Setting the cell type is now completely best effort.
  This fixes ``attrs`` on Jython.

  We cannot make any guarantees regarding Jython though, because our test suite cannot run due to dependency incompatabilities.

  `#321 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/321>`_,
  `#334 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/334>`_
- If ``attr.s`` is passed a *these* argument, it will not attempt to remove attributes with the same name from the class body anymore.

  `#322 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/322>`_,
  `#323 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/323>`_
- The hash of ``attr.NOTHING`` is now vegan and faster on 32bit Python builds.

  `#331 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/331>`_,
  `#332 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/332>`_
- The overhead of instantiating frozen dict classes is virtually eliminated.
  `#336 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/336>`_
- Generated ``__init__`` methods now have an ``__annotations__`` attribute derived from the types of the fields.

  `#363 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/363>`_
- We have restructured the documentation a bit to account for ``attrs``' growth in scope.
  Instead of putting everything into the `examples <http://www.attrs.org/en/stable/examples.html>`_ page, we have started to extract narrative chapters.

  So far, we've added chapters on `initialization <http://www.attrs.org/en/stable/init.html>`_ and `hashing <http://www.attrs.org/en/stable/hashing.html>`_.

  Expect more to come!

  `#369 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/369>`_,
  `#370 <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/issues/370>`_

Credits
=======

``attrs`` is written and maintained by `Hynek Schlawack <https://hynek.me/>`_.

The development is kindly supported by `Variomedia AG <https://www.variomedia.de/>`_.

A full list of contributors can be found in `GitHub's overview <https://github.com/python-attrs/attrs/graphs/contributors>`_.

It’s the spiritual successor of `characteristic <https://characteristic.readthedocs.io/>`_ and aspires to fix some of it clunkiness and unfortunate decisions.
Both were inspired by Twisted’s `FancyEqMixin <https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.python.util.FancyEqMixin.html>`_ but both are implemented using class decorators because `sub-classing is bad for you <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MNVP9-hglc>`_, m’kay?
