### Byzantine events
All of the following events indicate byzantine behaviour and that the user should either exit or challenge.

#### `invalid_exit`

{
    "event": "unchallenged_non_canonical_ife",
    "details": {
        "txbytes": "0xf3170101c0940000..."
    }
}
```

Indicates that there is unchallenged non canonical in-flight exit that is dangerously close to finalization and hasn't been challenged. User should exit.
See docs on [`unchallenged_exit` condition](../exit_validation.md#unchallenged-exit-condition) for more details.

Event details:

Attribute | Type | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
txbytes | Hex encoded string | The in-flight transaction that the event relates to

#### `invalid_ife_challenge`
> A invalid_ife_challenge event

```json

#### `piggyback_available`
> A piggyback_available event

```json
{
    "event": "piggyback_available",
    "details": {
        "txbytes": "0xf3170101c0940000...",
        "available_outputs" : [
            {"index": 0, "address": "0xb3256026863eb6ae5b06fa396ab09069784ea8ea"},
            {"index": 1, "address": "0x488f85743ef16cfb1f8d4dd1dfc74c51dc496434"},
        ],
        "available_inputs" : [
            {"index": 0, "address": "0xb3256026863eb6ae5b06fa396ab09069784ea8ea"}
        ],
    }
}
```

An in-flight exit has been started and can be piggybacked. If all inputs are owned by the same address, then `available_inputs` will not be present.
This event is reported only for in-flight exits from transactions that have not been included in a block.
If input or output of exiting transaction is piggybacked it does not show up as available for piggybacking.
When in-flight exit is finalized, transaction's inputs and outputs are not available for piggybacking.

Event details:

Attribute | Type | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
txbytes | Hex encoded string | The in-flight transaction that the event relates to
available_outputs | Object array | The outputs (index and address) available to be piggybacked
available_inputs | Object array | The inputs (index and address) available to be piggybacked

#### `invalid_piggyback`
> A invalid_piggyback event

```json
{
    "event": "invalid_piggyback",
    "details": {
        "txbytes": "0xf3170101c0940000...",
        "inputs": [1],
        "outputs": [0]
    }
}
```

An invalid piggyback is in process. Should be challenged.

Event details:

Attribute | Type | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
txbytes | Hex encoded string | The in-flight transaction that the event relates to
inputs | Integer array | A list of invalid piggybacked inputs
outputs | Integer array | A list of invalid piggybacked outputs

#### `unchallenged_piggyback`
> A invalid_piggyback event

```json
{
    "event": "unchallenged_piggyback",
    "details": {
        "txbytes": "0xf3170101c0940000...",
        "inputs": [1],
        "outputs": [0]
    }
}
```

An invalid piggyback is dangerously close to finalization and hasn't been challenged. User should exit.

Event details:

Attribute | Type | Description
--------- | ------- | -----------
txbytes | Hex encoded string | The in-flight transaction that the event relates to
inputs | Integer array | A list of invalid piggybacked inputs
