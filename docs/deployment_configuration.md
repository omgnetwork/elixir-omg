# Configuration via environment variables for deployment of Child Chain, Watcher and Watcher Info releases

***Child Chain, Watcher and Watcher Info***

- "PORT" - Child Chain or Watcher API port. Defaults to 9656 for Child Chain and 7434 for Watcher.
- "HOSTNAME" - server domain name of Child Chain or Watcher. *mandatory*
- "DD_DISABLED" - boolean that allows you to turn on or of Datadog metrics. Defaults to true.
- "APP_ENV" - environment name in which the the application was deployed. *mandatory*
- "DB_PATH" - directory of the KV db. *mandatory*
- "ETHEREUM_RPC_URL" - address of Geth or Parity instance. *mandatory*
- "ETH_NODE" - Geth, Parity or Infura. *mandatory*
- "SENTRY_DSN" - if not set, Sentry is disabled.
- "DD_HOSTNAME" - Datadog hostname.
- "DD_PORT" - Datadog agent UDP port for metrics.
- "DD_APM_PORT" - Datadog TCP port for APM.
- "BATCH_SIZE" - Datadog batch size for APM.
- "SYNC_THRESHOLD" - Datadog sync threshold for APM.
- "ETHEREUM_BLOCK_TIME_SECONDS" - Should mirror Ethereum network's setting, defaults to 15 seconds.
- "ETHEREUM_EVENTS_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS" - the frequency of HTTP requests towards the Ethereum clients and scanning for interested events. Should be less then average block time (10 to 20 seconds) on Ethereum mainnet.
- "ETHEREUM_STALLED_SYNC_THRESHOLD_MS" - the threshold before considering an unchanging Ethereum block height to be considered a stalled sync. Should be slightly larger than the expected block time.
- "LOGGER_BACKEND" - Ink or console. Ink will encode logs as json (useful for Datadog). Console will use the default elixir Logger backend. Default is Ink.

***Child Chain only***

- "FEE_ADAPTER" - The adapter to use to populate the fee specs. Either `file` or `feed` (case-insensitive). Defaults to `file` with an empty fee specs.
- "FEE_CLAIMER_ADDRESS" - 20-bytes HEX-encoded string of Ethereum address of Fee Claimer.
- "FEE_BUFFER_DURATION_MS" - Buffer period during which a fee is still valid after being updated.
- "FEE_SPECS_FILE_PATH" - The path to the fee specs file including the file name.  Only applicable when `FEE_ADAPTER=file`.
- "FEE_FEED_URL" - URL to fee feed service. Only applicable when `FEE_ADAPTER=feed`.
- "FEE_CHANGE_TOLERANCE_PERCENT" - Positive integer describes significance of price change. When price in new reading changes above tolerance level, prices are updated immediately. Otherwise update interval is preserved. Only applicable when `FEE_ADAPTER=feed`.
- "STORED_FEE_UPDATE_INTERVAL_MINUTES" - Positive integer describes time interval in minutes. The updates of token prices are carried out in update intervals as long as the changes are within tolerance. Only applicable when `FEE_ADAPTER=feed`.

***Watcher and Watcher Info only***

- "CHILD_CHAIN_URL" - Location of the Child Chain API. *mandatory*
- "EXIT_PROCESSOR_SLA_MARGIN" - Number of Ethereum blocks since start of an invalid exit, before `unchallenged_exit` is reported to prompt to mass exit. Must be smaller than "MIN_EXIT_PERIOD_SECONDS", unless "EXIT_PROCESSOR_SLA_MARGIN_FORCED=TRUE".

***Watcher Info only***

- "DATABASE_URL" - Postgres address *mandatory*

***Erlang VM configuration***

- "NODE_HOST" - The fully qualified host name of the current host.
- "ERLANG_COOKIE" - Magic cookie of the node.
- "REPLACE_OS_VARS" - An environment variable you export at runtime which instructed the tool to replace occurances of ${VAR} with the value from the system environment in the vm.args.

***Contract address configuration***
We allow a static configuration or a dynamic one, served as a http endpoint (one of them is mandatory).

- "ETHEREUM_NETWORK" - "RINKEBY" or "LOCALCHAIN".
- "CONTRACT_EXCHANGER_URL" - a server that can serve JSON in form of
```
{
  "plasma_framework_tx_hash":"<plasma_framework_tx_hash>",
  "plasma_framework":"<plasma_framework>",
  "eth_vault":"<eth_vault>",
  "erc20_vault":"<erc20_vault>",
  "payment_exit_game":"<payment_exit_game>",
  "authority_address":"<authority_address>"
}
```
Static configuration

- "ETHEREUM_NETWORK" - RINKEBY, ROPSTEN, MAINNET, or LOCALCHAIN
- "TXHASH_CONTRACT"
- "AUTHORITY_ADDRESS"
- "CONTRACT_ADDRESS_PLASMA_FRAMEWORK"
- "CONTRACT_ADDRESS_ETH_VAULT
- "CONTRACT_ADDRESS_ERC20_VAULT
- "CONTRACT_ADDRESS_PAYMENT_EXIT_GAME"

***Required contract addresses***

The contract addresses that are required to be included in the `contract_addr` field (or `_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` JSON) are:

```
{
  "plasma_framework": "...",
  "eth_vault": "...",
  "erc20_vault": "...",
  "payment_exit_game": "..."
}
```
