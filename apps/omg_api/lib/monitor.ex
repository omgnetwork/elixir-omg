defmodule OMG.API.Monitor do
  @moduledoc """
  This module is a custom implemented supervisor that monitors all it's chilldren
  and restarts them based on alarms raised. This means that in the period when Geth alarms are raised
  it would wait before it would restart them.

  When you receive an EXIT, check for an alarm raised that's related to Ethereum client synhronisation or connection
  problems and react accordingly.

  Children that need Ethereum client connectivity are OMG.API.EthereumEventListener
  OMG.API.BlockQueue.Server and OMG.API.RootChainCoordinator. For these children, we make
  additional checks if they exit. If there's an alarm raised of type :ethereum_client_connection we postpone
  the restart util the alarm is cleared. Other children are restarted immediately.
