  Represents a service that is coordinated by root chain coordinator.
  Such a service is expected to get root chain height by calling `RootChainCoordinator.get_height()` function
  and report processed height by calling `RootChainCoordiantor.check_in(height, service_name)`
  where `service_name` is a unique name of that service.
  Service is expected to handle `:sync` message that notifies about necessity to check synchronization status by calling
  `OMG.API.RootChainCoordinator.get_height/0`.
