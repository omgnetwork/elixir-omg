defmodule OMG.WatcherInfo.ReleaseTasks.EthereumTasks do
  @moduledoc """
  Some updates to data persisted in the `watcher-info` database require making calls to Ethereum.

  This task executes such updates. Currently, the only update is the addition of `eth_height`, but
  we anticipate that the need for database updates from Ethereum will arise in the future.

  Each update would make changes to the database ONCE per environment. For example, if no `ethevent`
  has an `eth_height` of `nil`, no Ethereum calls and subsequent database updates will be made, though
  a database query will check this condition at each deploy.

  An update can be "removed" once all environments have updated.

  A release task was chosen over a migration due to the risk associated with coupling a migration to
  Ethereumex.
