  Helper functions to provide behavior to FakeServer without using FakeServer defined macros.

  """

  @doc """
  Configures route for fake server to respond for given path with given response
  **Please note: **
  When the route is configured with a list of FakeServer.HTTP.Responses, the server will respond with the first element
  in the list and then remove it. This will be repeated for each request made for this route.
  Use `fn req -> response end` when you need to return always the same or modified response on every request

  Also first use of `with_route` changes configuration variable to child chain api to fake server, so invoke this
  function when fake response is needed.
