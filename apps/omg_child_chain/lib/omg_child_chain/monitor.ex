defmodule OMG.ChildChain.Monitor do
  @moduledoc """
  This module is a custom implemented supervisor that monitors all it's chilldren
  and restarts them based on alarms raised. This means that in the period when Geth alarms are raised
  it would wait before it would restart them.

  When you receive an EXIT, check for an alarm raised that's related to Ethereum client synhronisation or connection
  problems and reacts accordingly.

  If there's an alarm raised of type :ethereum_client_connection we postpone
  the restart util the alarm is cleared. Other children are restarted immediately.

  Implements a GenServer and callbacks of an alarm handler to be able to react to clearead alarms.
