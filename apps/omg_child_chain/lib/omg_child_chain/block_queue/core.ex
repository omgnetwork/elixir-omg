defmodule OMG.ChildChain.BlockQueue.Core do
  @moduledoc """
  Logic module for the `OMG.ChildChain.BlockQueue`

  Responsible for
   - keeping a queue of blocks lined up for submission to Ethereum.
   - determining the cadence of forming/submitting blocks to Ethereum.
   - determining correct gas price and ensuring submissions get mined eventually

  Relies on RootChain contract's 'authority' account not being used to send any other transactions, beginning from the
  nonce=1 transaction.

  Calculates gas price and resubmits using a higher gas price, if submissions are not being mined.
  See [section](#gas-price-selection)

  ### Form block deciding

  Orders to form a new block when:
    - a given number of new Ethereum blocks have been mined (e.g. once every approximately X * 15 seconds) since last
    submission done (`submitBlock` call on the root chain contract), and,
    - there is >= 1 transactions pending in `OMG.State`, that have been successfully executed

  ### Block Queue management

  Keeps track of all the recently formed child chain blocks. Decides when they can be considered definitely mined, in
  light of any reasonably deep reorgs of the root chains. In case resubmission is needed, applies the current gas price.

  Respects the [nonces restriction](https://github.com/omisego/elixir-omg/blob/master/docs/details.md#nonces-restriction)
  mechanism, i.e. the submission nonce is derived from the child chain block number to submit. Currently it is:
  nonce=1 blknum=1000, nonce=2 blknum=2000 etc.

  ### Gas price selection

  The mechanism employed is minimalistic, aiming at:
    - pushing formed block submissions as reliably as possible, avoiding delayed mining of submissions as much as possible
    - saving Ether only when certain that we're overpaying
    - being simple and avoiding any external factors driving the mechanism

  The mechanics goes as follows:

  If:
    - we've got a new child block formed, whose submission isn't yet mined and
    - it's been more than 2 (`OMG.ChildChain.BlockQueue.GasPriceAdjustment.eth_gap_without_child_blocks`) root chain blocks
    since a submission has last been seen mined

  the gas price is raised by a factor of 2 (`OMG.ChildChain.BlockQueue.GasPriceAdjustment.gas_price_raising_factor`)

  **NOTE** there's also an upper limit for the gas price (`OMG.ChildChain.BlockQueue.GasPriceAdjustment.max_gas_price`)

  If:
    - we've got a new child block formed, whose submission isn't yet mined and
    - it's been no more than 2 (`OMG.ChildChain.BlockQueue.GasPriceAdjustment.eth_gap_without_child_blocks`) root chain blocks
    since a submission has last been seen mined

  the gas price is lowered by a factor of 0.9 ('OMG.ChildChain.BlockQueue.GasPriceAdjustment.gas_price_lowering_factor')

    - **known transaction** - this is common and expected to occur, since we are tracking submissions ourselves and

    - **low replacement price** - due to the gas price selection mechanism, there are cases where transaction will get
      resubmitted with a lower gas price; this is ignored
    - **account locked** - Ethereum node reports the authority account is locked; this causes a crash
    - **nonce too low** - there is an inherent race condition - when we're resubmitting a block, we do it with the same
      nonce, meanwhile it might happen that Ethereum mines this submission in this very instant; this is ignored if we
