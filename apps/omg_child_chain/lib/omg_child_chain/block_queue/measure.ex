  Counting business metrics sent to Datadog.
  We don't want to pattern match on :ok to Datadog because the connection
  towards the statsd client can be intermittent and sending would be unsuccessful and that
  would trigger the removal of telemetry handler. But because we have monitors in place,
  that eventually recover the connection to Statsd handlers wouldn't exist anymore and metrics
  wouldn't be published.
