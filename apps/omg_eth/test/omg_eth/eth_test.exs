defmodule OMG.EthTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Thin smoke test of the Ethereum port/adapter.
  The purpose of this test to only prod the marshalling and calling functionalities of the `Eth` wrapper.
  This shouldn't test the contract and should rely as little as possible on the contract logic.
  `OMG.Eth` is intended to be as thin and deprived of own logic as possible, to not require extensive testing.

  Note the excluded moduletag, this test requires an explicit `--include wrappers`
