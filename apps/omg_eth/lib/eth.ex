defmodule OMG.Eth do
  @moduledoc """
  Library for common code of the adapter/port to contracts deployed on Ethereum.

  NOTE: The library code is not intended to be used outside of `OMG.Eth`: use `OMG.Eth.RootChain` and `OMG.Eth.Token` as main
  entrypoints to the contract-interaction functionality.

  NOTE: This wrapper is intended to be as thin as possible, only offering a consistent API to the Ethereum JSONRPC client and contracts.

  Handles other non-contract queries to the Ethereum client.

  Notes on encoding: All APIs of `OMG.Eth` and the submodules with contract APIs always use raw, decoded binaries
  for binaries - never use hex encoded binaries. Such binaries may be passed as is onto `ABI` related functions,
  however they must be encoded/decoded when entering/leaving the `Ethereumex` realm
