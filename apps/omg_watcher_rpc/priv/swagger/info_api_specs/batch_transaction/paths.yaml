    summary: This endpoint submits an array of signed transaction to the child chain.

      Normally you should call the Watcher's Transaction - Submit instead of this.
      The Watcher's version performs various security and validation checks (TO DO) before submitting the transaction,
      so is much safer. However, if the Watcher is not available this version exists.
