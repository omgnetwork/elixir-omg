defmodule OMG.InternalEventBus do

  Thin wrapper around the pubsub mechanism allowing us to not repeat ourselves when starting/broadcasting/subscribing

  All of the messages published will have `:internal_bus_event` prepended to the tuple to distinguish them

  ### Topics and messages

  #### `enqueue_block`

  Is being broadcast on a local node whenever `OMG.State` completes forming of a new child chain block

  Message: {:internal_event_bus, :enqueue_block, OMG.Block.t()}

  #### `emit_events`

  Is being broadcast to all nodes whenever an event trigger, that should be turned into a push event in `Eventer` occurs

  Message: {;internal_event, :emit_events, list()}
